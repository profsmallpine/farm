        %span.highlight Creamery Intern:
        internships are a wonderful 3 month introductory opportunity to working
        on a farmstead creamery business. Tasks include milking sheep, feeding
        animals, affinage, making fresh cheese, packing cheese for orders,
        cleaning dishes and maintenance projects.

        %span.highlight Creamery Apprentice:
        apprenticeships are a full education and immersion into the operation of
        a farmstead creamery. No previous experience is required, but an eager
        attitude for learning and appreciation for artisan cheese is a must. The
        training and exposure builds in complexity, starting with milking,
        animal care, affinage, cleaning dishes, maintenance projects and fresh
        cheese making techniques. It then builds towards learning our farmâ€™s full
        range of 8-10 cheeses (which vary among hard cheeses, aged blues, and
        young semi-soft small wheels).
