                      Firm but not dry with gracefully smooth nutty flavors.
                      We wash this cheese every few days with a local Montana
                      brewery's Oatmeal Stout, insuring a soft, easy slicing
                      texture and a beautiful rind, as well as imparting hints
                      of the beer’s unique flavor, creating a unique experience.
                      The smooth texture makes this a great slicing cheese and
                      the colorful rind makes it stand out on a cheese board.
                      This cheese was highlighted in Sip Northwest’s 2015 Best
                      of the West issue, paired with a local cider from Montana
                      Ciderworks. Aged a minimum of 3 months.

                      Our oldest cheese, perfect for grating but also for
                      slicing. The Sentinel is aged for a minimum of 8 months,
                      giving this cheese a distinct sharp and spicy flavor with
                      mild buttery characteristics. Savor this cheese grated on
                      top of your favorite pasta dish, or for desert with honey
                      drizzled over the top.

                      A bloomy-rind blue cheese. This is a rich and creamy brie
                      style cheese with a soft smooth paste. We then contrast the
                      supple Brie by adding p. roqueforti culture (a blue cheese
                      mold), rounding out the cheese with the spicy piquancy of
                      a blue. Delightful with a fresh French baguette but also
                      great baked by itself or in a pastry crust. It is
                      particularly important with this cheese to let it warm to
                      room temperature before enjoying to get its true flavor
                      and texture. The rind on this cheese is edible and
                      delicious and should be enjoyed as part of the experience.

                      Our “baby” (young) blue cheese.  “Baby” in size and age
                      but not in flavor with a rich creamy texture and lots of
                      blue both on the inside but also on the rind. Enjoy with a
                      tart apple, or do as the French do and top your buttered
                      bread with some blue. This cheese melts well and can turn
                      an ordinary burger into something remarkable. The rind on
                      this cheese is edible and delicious and should be enjoyed
                      as part of the experience.

                      This is a traditional ricotta, made with 100% sheep’s
                      milk whey. Whey ricotta is uniquely different from
                      ricotta made from milk – whole milk is used
                      industrially to increase the yield. Our 100% whey
                      ricotta is light, sweet and drier than its
                      mass-produced counterpart. Enjoy simply with fresh
                      summer fruit or with your favorite pasta dishes. This
                      is ricotta the whey it was meant to be.

                    .menu-detail
                      Traditional Feta is made of 100% sheep’s milk or a
                      combination of sheep and goat milk (only 30% goats milk is
                      allowed in traditional feta). Our traditionally crafted
                      sheep’s milk feta is smooth and creamy in texture, as only
                      sheep milk cheeses can be, it is slightly salty and heavy
                      on the cream in its flavor profile. Sticking to tradition,
                      we sell our feta in whey brine (the salted whey from
                      making the feta) instead of just in a salt brine.

                      A delicate fresh cheese with a perfect balance of decadent

                      breakfast or crumbled on a salads or roasted vegetables.
                      Perfect addition to any summer salad or added to winter
                      comfort foods for an extra velvety texture.
